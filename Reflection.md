# Reflection – SAB3 Bootstrap Project

Creating this project helped me understand how to build responsive web layouts using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I learned how to structure content using containers, rows, and columns, and how to style elements with Bootstrap classes and custom CSS.

I enjoyed experimenting with images, backgrounds, and buttons to make the design visually appealing. Linking each feature card to its own page gave me confidence in managing navigation and layout consistency across multiple files.

One challenge I faced was matching image sizes across all cards. I solved this by using `object-fit: cover` and setting a fixed height, which made the layout clean and balanced.

Overall, this project improved my skills in frontend development and gave me a better understanding of how to turn a design into a working website. I'm proud of the final result and excited to keep learning more.
